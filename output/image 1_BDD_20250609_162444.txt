 Feature: Tree Sitter Parser Functionality in Retail Application

   Scenario: Verify the correct retrieval of context code using Tree Sitter Parser
      Given I have the retail application open and ready for use
      And I have a text string containing the Tree Sitter Parser command
       When I input the text string into the application
       Then the system should parse the text and retrieve the context code correctly
         And the retrieved context code should be displayed on the screen
         And I should verify that the retrieved context code matches the expected value "4"

   Scenario: Verify the retrieval of additional information using Tree Sitter Parser
      Given I have the retail application open and ready for use
      And I have a text string containing the Tree Sitter Parser command with multiple fields
       When I input the text string into the application
       Then the system should parse the text and retrieve the necessary information correctly
         And the retrieved information (Context Code, Docs, and question) should be displayed on the screen separately
         And I should verify that the retrieved context code matches the expected value "8"
         And I should verify that the retrieved documents are accessible and contain the correct information
         And I should verify that the retrieved question is relevant to the given text

   Scenario: Verify the Tree Sitter Parser's ability to handle errors gracefully
      Given I have the retail application open and ready for use
      And I input an incorrect or malformed text string into the Tree Sitter Parser
       When I attempt to parse the text
       Then the system should recognize the error and display a clear and concise error message
         And I should not be able to retrieve any information from the parsed text
         And I should verify that the displayed error message indicates the nature of the error (e.g., missing field, incorrect syntax)
         And I should have the option to correct the error and try again with the Tree Sitter Parser command
