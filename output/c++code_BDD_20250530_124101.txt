 Feature: Verifying the Correctness of Bubble Sort Function

   Scenario: Executing the Bubble Sort function with an array of integers
      Given I have an integer array defined as follows: [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
      When I execute the bubbleSort function on this array and get a sorted array
      Then The sorted array should be in ascending order: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]

   Scenario: Verifying the correctness of the helper printArray function for arrays
      Given I have an integer array defined as follows: [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
      When I call the printArray function with this array and its size
      Then The output should display the original unsorted array followed by the sorted array separated by a newline: "Original array:\n64 34 25 12 22 11 90\nSorted array:\n11 12 22 25 34 64 90"

   Scenario: Checking the size of the input integer array for bubbleSort function
      Given I have an integer array defined with a specific size
      When I call the bubbleSort function with this array and its size
      Then The size passed to the bubbleSort function should match the actual size of the array

   Scenario: Checking the execution of the if condition in the bubbleSort function
      Given I have an integer array defined as follows: [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
      When I run the bubbleSort function on this array and check for swaps during sorting
      Then The if condition in the bubbleSort function should trigger swaps when necessary to sort the array correctly

   Scenario: Checking the swap operation within the bubbleSort function
      Given I have an integer array defined as follows: [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
      When I run the bubbleSort function on this array and observe the swap operations
      Then The correct elements should be swapped during the sorting process to achieve a sorted array: [64->34, 34->25, 25->12, 12->22, 22->11]

   Scenario: Verifying the existence of the temp variable in the bubbleSort function
      Given I have an integer array defined as follows: [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
      When I run the bubbleSort function on this array and observe the usage of the temp variable
      Then The temp variable should be used to store and swap the elements in the correct positions during sorting
