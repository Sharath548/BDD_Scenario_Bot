 Feature: Verify Certificate of Completion

    Scenario: User wants to verify a certificate for a specific employee
      Given I am an administrator with access to the employee management system
      And I have the necessary credentials to log in
      When I navigate to the "Employee" section and search for "sharath chandrareddy"
      And I select the appropriate result from the search results
      When I go to the "Certificates" tab for the selected employee
      Then I should see a certificate named "Macys Introduction to Enactor Certification Test ap 1, 2028, 217 pm Mike Carrell" in the list
      And when I click on this certificate
      Then I should be able to view its details such as issue date, issuer name, and whether the employee has passed or failed
      And the certificate status should show "Passed" for the selected employee

    Scenario: User wants to verify if a specific certificate exists for an employee but it does not exist
      Given I am an administrator with access to the employee management system
      And I have the necessary credentials to log in
      When I navigate to the "Employee" section and search for "sharath chandrareddy"
      And I select the appropriate result from the search results

      Then I should not see a certificate named "Macys Introduction to Enactor Certification Test ap 1, 2028, 217 pm Mike Carrell" in the list
      And when I search for that specific certificate within all employees
      Then I should not find any matching results
